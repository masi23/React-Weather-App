React-Weather-App
This project is a simple weather app created by using JavaScript and React library.

It allows you to find out weather information about specific locations (cities) all around the world.

How to use it? Type in requested city name. The app will connect with external database by popular, free service weatherapi.com . Information you can find out is: -temperature -short weather description -pressure -visibility -humidity -wind speed and direction -air quality index presented on simple measure bar. As a bonus, the app shows small piece of weather data by itself, presenting temperature and short description about 3 popular cities on a navbar.

About the project: Purpose of creating this app is nothing else than just learning React library. I can say that it's one of my first projects developed with React. First of all I focused on proper display and processing of data. Because of that the quality of designand overall look is a little bit lower. Also I haven't spent any time on preparing responsive design so eventual using is recommended only on desktop.
